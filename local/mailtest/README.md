Description
-----------
The Moodle MailTest module allows administrators to test Moodle's email
system. A trace of the SMTP dialogue will be displayed if the email message
cannot be sent for any reason.

Once the test email has been sent, you will need to check your email inbox
to confirm that the email message was successfully delivered. This plugin
will not do that for you.

Requirements
------------
This plugin requires Moodle 2.5+ from http://moodle.org

Changes
-------
2015-11-01 - Initial version.

For more information, see CHANGELOG.md.

Installation and Update
-----------------------

/local/mailtest

on installing Moodle plugins.

There are no special considerations required for updating the plugin.

Unininstallation
----------------
Uninstalling the plugin by going into the following:

...and click Uninstall. You may also need to delete the following folder:

Usage & Settings
----------------
The local_mailtest plugin is designed allow administrators to test Moodle
to ensure the email message system is correctly configured.

There are no settings for this plugin.

Once installed, login as an administrator and then click:

    Home > Site Administration > Server > Mail Test

Enter the email address of the recipient where you want to send the message
and click the [Send a test message] button.

If the email message was successfully sent by Moodle, you will see a message
that says "Success - The test message was successfully delivered to the SMTP
server.". If it fails to send the email, a dialogue between the Moodle and
the SMTP server will be displayed.

is restricted to logged in Moodle administrators only.

FAQ
---
Question: Why do I get a 500 server error when I use MailTest?
Answer: This plugin has been extensively tested and used on hundreds of sites.
If you are getting this error, it is likely that you have a permissions
issue on your server which needs to be resolved.

Question: Why does it say that Moodle sent the test message succesfully yet
I did not receive the email?
Answer: This could be due to a number of reasons including but not limited to:

* Incorrect PHP Mail settings in your php.ini file (if you have not configured
Moodle's SMTP settings).
* You may have an antivirus or firewall blocking email communications.
* The mail server receiving your email may be discarding emails received from
your site.
* The test email may be blocked by anti-spam filters. Check your junk mail folder.

Question: How do I find out the correct email settings I should be using?
Answer: Contact your network administrator or your Web Hosting provider. These
are typically the same settings as you would use for an email client but the
administrator may need to add special settings to allow emails to be sent from
your support and no-reply email addresses.

Question: Why is the test emails not being sent succesfully?
Answer: Your SMTP email settings are incorrect or the mail server is refusing
emails coming from your Moodle site. Read the whole dialogue that is displayed
when you send a test message. It will often provide some hint of where the
problem might be.

Question: What is the difference between PHP Mail and Moodle SMTP Mail?
Answer: If you don't configure the mail settings in Moodle, Moodle will hand
off the delivery of email to PHP's built-in mail system. Its settings are
typically in your server's PHP.INI file. If you do configure the SMTP
settings in Moodle, it will attempt to deliver emails directly to the
SMTP server.

Question: How can I use this tool to send emails to other email addresses?
Answer: You can't at the moment. If you really must, temporarily apply the
email address to one of the three "From" addresses: 

* Your user account
* No-reply
* Support
